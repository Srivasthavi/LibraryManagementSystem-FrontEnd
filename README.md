## FrontEnd Role Task-Library Management System
### Problem Statement
Build a simple library management page where:

- Users should be able to see the list of books
- Instead of loading all the results on the page, perform paging on the list of books (implement 10 results per page or load on scroll will be a bonus)
- Users should be able to filter the list of books based on Title, Author, Subject and Publish Date
- User should be able to see the count of books in based on each criteria [ Title, Author, Subject and Publish Date]

### WEBSITE:
dev-rev-lms-main-pic1 

dev-rev-lms-search-pic2

[#note: Here is a detailed description about my thoughtprocess and what I did step by step to develop the front-end for this task.]

### Step-1: Identifying the basic elements needed and the design.
The basic elements for the library management system website would be (according to the given problem statement as well.)

Navigation Bar with sign-up and login options.
The title of the website-which in this case would be - "Library".
Search bar option - with filters.
List of Books - with the details-[Title, Author, Subject and Publish Date]
Scroll Bar option
Pagination
Count of books available
The design would be:

Identifying a good background picture. (I have noticed that in a lot of cases websites are more attractive, if the background is not just a color or a mix of colors but if it is a hd imgae and related to the topic and more visible if its in a darker shade and with a little bit of opacity.)
The aesthetic colors of the elements ,the fonts, and size should match to the background - match to the aesthetic vibe of the website.

### Step-2:
Now, that we know what we and what we should do its time to implement our idea.

html main page
css style sheet
JavaScript file
Json File- Data-List of books with its respective details
Background image
login and sign-up page - (this would be part of back-end using php and mysql server)
